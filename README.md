# Web-Based Goods Damage Complaint Information System

The Goods Damage Complaints Information System is a digital platform designed to facilitate the process of reporting, data collection and handling goods damage in an organization or agency. This system allows users to submit complaints regarding damaged goods quickly and efficiently through an easy-to-use interface.

Key features include:
1. Complaint Form: Users can fill in the details of the damaged item, including a description of the damage, item location, and severity.
2. Notification and Follow-up: After a report is submitted, the system automatically sends a notification to the relevant team for immediate follow-up and improvement.
3. Complaint Status Tracking: Users can monitor the status of their complaints, whether they are being processed, corrected or completed.
4. Reports and Analysis: The system also provides data analysis features to identify items that are frequently damaged and make decisions easier regarding item maintenance.

With this system, the complaint process and handling of damaged goods becomes more structured, transparent and well documented, so that work efficiency can increase.
